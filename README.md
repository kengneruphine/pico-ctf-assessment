# Start Problem Development

Welcome! At the time of writing, this documentation is maintained by LT
'syreal' Jones. Feel free to reach out with questions, comments or 
suggestions [here](mailto:other@picoctf.org).



## Setup

Install [cmgr](https://github.com/ArmyCyberInstitute/cmgr#quickstart).



## Walkthroughs

These walkthroughs proceed roughly in order of complexity, from least complex
challenge to most complex challenge. These are great problems to start problem
development with.

1. [Sanity, static flag](/example-problems/sanity-static-flag/)
2. [Forensics Grep](/example-problems/forensics-grep/)
3. [Forensics Disk](/example-problems/forensics-disk/)
4. [Custom Docker](/example-problems/custom-ssh/)
5. [Custom Web](/example-problems/custom-web/)

In addition to these walkthroughs, you can also check the `cmgr` developers'
[example problems,](https://github.com/ArmyCyberInstitute/cmgr/tree/master/examples)
which are a good source for more complex problem development.
