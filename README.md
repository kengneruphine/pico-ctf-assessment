# Start Problem Development

Welcome! At the time of writing, this documentation is maintained by [LT
'syreal' Jones](https://pages.syreal.cc/portfolio/business-card) Feel free to
reach out with questions, comments or suggestions.



## Setup

There are 2 primary ways to start problem development for picoCTF: 1. Install
[cmgr](https://github.com/ArmyCyberInstitute/cmgr) on one of your machines 2.
Ask [LT](https://pages.syreal.cc/portfolio/business-card) for an account on the
Problem Development Playground (which already has `cmgr` installed and its
dependencies).

Option 1 of installing `cmgr` on your own machine will give you the most
freedom and flexibility, though you will need to install Docker on your 
machine. Option 2 of contacting LT to get access to the Problem Development
Playground will help you get started as hassle-free as possible.



## Walkthroughs

These walkthroughs proceed roughly in order of complexity, from least complex
challenge to most complex challenge. "Sanity" in this context refers to the 
easiest problem in a CTF that can be used as a sanity check. These are great
problems to start problem development with.

1. Sanity, static flag
2. Sanity, dynamic flag
3. Forensics, static artifact
4. Forensics, dynamic artifact
5. Reverse Engineering
6. Cryptography
7. Binary Exploitation
8. Web Exploitation

In addition to these walkthroughs, you can also check the `cmgr` developers'
[example problems,](https://github.com/ArmyCyberInstitute/cmgr/tree/master/examples)
which are a good source for more complex problem development.
