# Start Problem Development

Welcome! At the time of writing, this documentation is maintained by [LT
'syreal' Jones](https://pages.syreal.cc/portfolio/business-card). Feel free to
reach out with questions, comments or suggestions.



## Setup

Install [cmgr](https://github.com/ArmyCyberInstitute/cmgr#quickstart).



## Walkthroughs

These walkthroughs proceed roughly in order of complexity, from least complex
challenge to most complex challenge. These are great problems to start problem
development with.

1. [Sanity, static flag](/example-problems/sanity-static-flag/)
2. Sanity, dynamic flag
3. Forensics
4. Reverse Engineering
5. Cryptography
6. Binary Exploitation
7. Web Exploitation

In addition to these walkthroughs, you can also check the `cmgr` developers'
[example problems,](https://github.com/ArmyCyberInstitute/cmgr/tree/master/examples)
which are a good source for more complex problem development.
