# Grep Problem Creation Walkthrough



## Pre-requisites:

1. You have `cmgr` installed and configured.
    - Refer to the [setup section in the index](/README.md#setup)
      if this is not the case for you.

2. You have done the [Sanity Problem Creation Walkthrough](/example-problems/sanity-static-flag/README.md).
   You do not have to do every walkthrough that is listed as easier than this
   one, but you must at least do the Sanity Problem Creation Walkthrough. 
   This walkthrough is presented as a set of changes from the sanity problem.
   The sanity problem walkthrough is the core of cmgr challenges, and this 
   problem presents what must be added on top of that for a more complicated
   challenge.



## Overview

This problem is the perennial grep problem. We have a problem like this almost
every year. It is different from Sanity because though it is still simple, it
does teach a computer skill: using grep.

There are 3 main changes in this problem that make it more interesting:

1. The addition of 3 new files: packages.txt, war-and-peace.txt, and 
   byteblast.py.

2. Makefile has more targets.

3. Problem is marked as Templatable in problem.md. This means that multiple
   instances of this problem can be ran, each having a different flag.

By these changes we go from giving the flag out to anyone who can download it
to hiding it deep within a large classic novel.
